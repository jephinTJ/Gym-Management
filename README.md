gym management website for - Z-Gen Fitness.

My project is a full stack website for gym management. The website provides a comprehensive platform for gym owners and managers to manage their gym operations, including member management, scheduling, and payment processing. 

The website has been developed using the XAMPP server, which provides a platform for developing web applications that can be easily deployed on a live server. The XAMPP server combines the Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP scripting language, which makes it a popular choice for developing web applications.

The website has been designed with a clean and user-friendly interface that enables gym members to easily navigate and access the various features and services offered by the gym. The website provides a dashboard that displays key metrics such as the number of members, revenue, and other important data that helps gym owners and managers make informed decisions.

The backend of the website has been designed to be scalable, secure, and reliable. It provides the necessary tools and functionalities to manage gym operations efficiently, including member management, class scheduling, and payment processing. The backend also includes an admin panel that enables gym owners and managers to easily add and manage new trainers, classes, and services offered by the gym.

Overall, the gym management full stack website developed for Z-Gen Fitness is a powerful and efficient tool that helps gym owners and managers manage their gym operations effectively. The website has been designed with the user in mind and provides a seamless experience for gym members, enabling them to access all the services and features offered by the gym with ease.
